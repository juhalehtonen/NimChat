# NimChat
A simple chat app (client & server) written in Nim. Based on the great contents of the *Nim in Action* book.

## Compiling and running
You'll need Nim installed and set up on your system. Once that is done, follow the steps below:

1. Run `nim c src/server.nim` and `nim c src/client.nim`
2. Run `./src/server` on the server and `./src/client <server IP> <username>` on the client(s)
